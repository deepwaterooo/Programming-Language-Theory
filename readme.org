#+title: Programming Language Theory -- Summer 2016
#+author: deepwaterooo

* Introduction
- On the stage of trying to figure and draw of a 27 small cubes composed big cube layout.
- Still trying to understand and have a taste of most of the essencial abstract concepts. 
- opengl GLUT environment ready, but I don't feel I am familiar with the language yet. And so far, I don't have clear idea yet on how am I going to design the project and what kind of date structures am I going to use. 
- Will spend some more hours on it, and draw as much as I could before the deadline. And if I could NOT finish this project on time, I am 99% sure that I won't be able to, I will find some other chance to implement this magic cube project using some other more popular languages, like c++ or java or any better choice later on. 
- hw2: haskell practice exercise code for any practice due on 6/15/2016 11:59pm.
- 
- Considering that I understand the way how to traverse and draw different parts of the zombie, I know I could but don't have to take all the effort to draw all the fingers in order to make a "fighting" pose (a hand cube stands for another "zombie"-like rotatation for 2 or 3 different finger parts). 
- I don't like the latter part of the project during to rotating simply around the center, though I want to make the zombie walk (but I don't have enough time to work on it). While I will try to work on the walking for a few (3-4) hours tonight to be able to at least have some taste. 
- My team buddy's spiderman Dancing stage could simply be rendered by defining the four glVertex3d vertex ([-25, -9.4, 25], [25, -9.4, 25], [25, -9.4, -25], [-25, -9.4, -25]), tex coordinate four points (00 10 11 01), and a Texture. By including norm data, it supposed to have some lights. 
- Todos: 
  - Speed a few hours (3-4) tonight to work on the zombie walking. 
  - Need try hard to figure out animation, how to dance with time changes, or need to move according to keytype inputs triggers. 
  - Sub obj% for cubes, and spheres if I need and want to implement any sphere for head, or eyes. But it seems I won't have enough time for this one now. Will try these ones through other projects later on then. 
- A current rotatable zombie and my team buddy's spiderman are looking like:
